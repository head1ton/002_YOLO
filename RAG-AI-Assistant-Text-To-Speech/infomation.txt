Retrieval Component

The system extracts text from an uploaded PDF (get_pdf_text).
It splits the text into chunks using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter (split_text).
The text chunks are embedded using Google Generative AI Embeddings and stored in a FAISS vector database (create_vector_store).
At query time, the most relevant text chunks are retrieved using FAISS similarity search (handle_query).
Generation Component

The retrieved text chunks serve as context for the AI model.
A Groq model (qwen-2.5-32b) generates a response based on both the query and the retrieved context.
